I am a Ph.D. candidate of the [Menden Lab](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/icb/research-groups/menden-lab) at [Helmholtz Centre Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/), under the joint supervision of [Michael Menden](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1048557-michael-menden), [Natalie Garzorz-Stark](https://dermagnostix.com/about-us/) and [Francesco Paolo Casale](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en/research-group-lab-77/francesco-paolo-casale). Besides, I am honored to be part of the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) residency with [Theofanis Karaletsos](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=zrxafGsAAAAJ&hl=de).

I am a computational biologist passionate about advancing precision medicine through machine learning and statistical genetics, with particular expertise in inflammatory diseases. During my Ph.D., I developed SAFARI, a biomarker detection framework that revealed a sparse gene signature distinguishing early Mycosis Fungoides (MF) patients from those with benign inflammatory skin diseases. This work was patented and is leveraged by [Dermagnostix](https://dermagnostix.com/pipeline-products/) in their emerging diagnostic tool ''LymphX''. 
Within the collaboration with the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/), I combine statistical genetics with multiple instance learning to pinpoint cellular contexts in which genes act as disease drivers, revealing mechanistic insights that inform therapeutic target identification.
