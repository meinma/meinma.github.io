abstract: Highly effective targeted therapies are available to treat noncommunicable
  chronic inflammatory skin diseases. In contrast, the exact diagnosis of noncommunicable
  chronic inflammatory skin diseases is complicated by its complex pathogenesis and
  clinical and histological overlap. Particularly, the differential diagnosis of psoriasis
  and eczema can be challenging in some cases, and molecular diagnostic tools need
  to be developed to support a gold standard diagnosis. The aim of this work was to
  develop a real-time PCR-based molecular classifier to distinguish psoriasis from
  eczema in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded-fixed skin samples and to evaluate
  the use of minimally invasive microbiopsies and tape strips for molecular diagnosis.
  In this study, we present a formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded–based molecular
  classifier that determines the probability for psoriasis with a sensitivity/specificity
  of 92%/100%, respectively, and an area under the curve of 0.97, delivering comparable
  results to our previous published RNAprotect-based molecular classifier. The psoriasis
  probability, as well as levels of NOS2 expression, positively correlated with the
  disease hallmarks of psoriasis and negatively with eczema hallmarks. Furthermore,
  minimally invasive tape strips and microbiopsies were effectively used to differentiate
  psoriasis from eczema. In summary, the molecular classifier offers broad usage in
  pathology laboratories as well as outpatient settings and can support the differential
  diagnosis of noncommunicable chronic inflammatory skin diseases on a molecular level
  using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue, microbiopsies, and tape strips.
