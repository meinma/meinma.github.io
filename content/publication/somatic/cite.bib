 abstract = {Abstract Mechanistic insight into ageing may empower prolonging the lifespan of humans; however, a complete understanding of this process is still lacking despite a plethora of ageing theories. In order to address this, we investigated the association of lifespan with eight phenotypic traits, that is, litter size, body mass, female and male sexual maturity, somatic mutation, heart, respiratory, and metabolic rate. In support of the somatic mutation theory, we analysed 15 mammalian species and their whole-genome sequencing deriving somatic mutation rate, which displayed the strongest negative correlation with lifespan. All remaining phenotypic traits showed almost equivalent strong associations across this mammalian cohort, however, resting heart rate explained additional variance in lifespan. Integrating somatic mutation and resting heart rate boosted the prediction of lifespan, thus highlighting that resting heart rate may either directly influence lifespan, or represents an epiphenomenon for additional lower-level mechanisms, for example, metabolic rate, that are associated with lifespan.},
