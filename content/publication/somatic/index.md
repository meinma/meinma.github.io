abstract: Mechanistic insight into ageing may empower prolonging the lifespan
  of humans; however, a complete understanding of this process is still lacking despite
  a plethora of ageing theories. In order to address this, we investigated the association
  of lifespan with eight phenotypic traits, that is, litter size, body mass, female
  and male sexual maturity, somatic mutation, heart, respiratory, and metabolic rate.
  In support of the somatic mutation theory, we analysed 15 mammalian species and
  their whole-genome sequencing deriving somatic mutation rate, which displayed the
  strongest negative correlation with lifespan. All remaining phenotypic traits showed
  almost equivalent strong associations across this mammalian cohort, however, resting
  heart rate explained additional variance in lifespan. Integrating somatic mutation
  and resting heart rate boosted the prediction of lifespan, thus highlighting that
  resting heart rate may either directly influence lifespan, or represents an epiphenomenon
  for additional lower-level mechanisms, for example, metabolic rate, that are associated
  with lifespan.
