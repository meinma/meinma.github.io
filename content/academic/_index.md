### SAFARI accepted as Findings Paper at [Machine Learning for Health workshop](https://ml4h.cc/2023/)
My findings submission about ''SAFARI - a framework for **S**parse biom**a**rker detection **f**or r**ar**e d**i**seases'' got accepted at the ''Machine Learning for Health'' workshop in New Orleans. I presented a poster on the 10th of December in the morning session. Afterward, I attended Neurips and got to know and get in touch with many researchers in the field. ![ML4H](../../assets/media/ML4H.jpg)

### Patent registration "Differential diagnosis of mycosis fungoides, method and system"
Eczema, one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases, and cutaneous T Cell lymphoma share an incredibly similar phenotype, making early and proper diagnosis challenging for dermatologists. However, the correct early diagnosis is of utmost importance for cutaneous T Cell lymphoma patients, as this is the only stage where it is still curable, enabling regular life expectancies. For this problem, I developed the framework SAFARI - a framework for **S**parse biom**a**rkers **f**or r**ar**e d**i**seases. With my collaborators from the Eyerich Lab, we patented several potential biomarkers to support dermatologists in their clinical decision-making. At the moment, we are working on the validation of the discovered biomarkers.

### ML x Health Summer school in Oxford
The next highlight followed immediately with the summer school on ML x Health, where I listened to many talks about various applications in healthcare. For me, the ones referring to multi-modal learning were exciting since I am working on one project combining time series data of imaging with transcriptomics to identify biomarkers, revealing whether patients are sensitive to a particular drug. 
For the entire topic of multi-modal learning, the talk of [Louis-Phillipe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) was highly inspiring.

### EADV ESDR Summer Research Workshop in Freiburg
In July 2023, I was invited with my colleague Christina Hillig to present ''Biocomputational analysis of big data'' at the EADV ESDR Summer research workshop hosted by [Kilian Eyerich](https://www.med.uni-freiburg.de/de/fakultaet/profs/Eyerich). It was a great chance to meet and connect with scientists from various scientific backgrounds (Medicine, biology, computer science) working on inflammatory skin diseases.
My highlight of the event was meeting my supervisor, Natalie Garzorz-Stark, and my collaborators Stefanie and Kilian Eyerich in person for the first time and getting to know each other better to establish further collaborations.
