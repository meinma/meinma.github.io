### SAFARI accepted as Findings Paper at [Machine Learning for Health workshop](https://ml4h.cc/2023/)
My four pages extended abstract about ''SAFARI - a framework for **S**parse biom**a**rker detection **f**or r**ar**e d**i**seases'' got accepted at the Machine Learning 4 Health Workshop in New Orleans. I presented a poster on the 10th of December in the morning session. Afterwards I attented Neurips and got to know and in touch with many researchers in the field. ![ML4H](../../assets/media/ML4H.jpg)

### Patent registration "Differential diagnosis if mycosis fungoides, method and system"
Eczema, one of the most common inflammatory skin diseases, and cutaneous T Cell lymphoma share an incredibly similar phenotype, which makes the early and right diagnosis challenging for dermatologists. However, the correct diagnosis at an early stage is from utmost importance for cutanoues T Cell lymphoma patients, as this is the only stage, where it is still curable, enabling regular life expectancies. For this problem I developed the framework SAFARI - a framework for **S**parse biom**a**rkers **f**or r**ar**e d**i**seases. Together with my collaborators from the Eyerich Lab we patented several potential biomarkers to support dermatologists in their clinical decision making. At the moment we are working on the validation of the discovered biomarkers.

### EADV ESDR Summer Research Workshop in Freiburg
In July I was invited with my colleague Christina Hillig to give a talk about ''Biocomputational analysis of big data'' at the EADV ESDR Summer research workshop hosted by [Kilian Eyerich](https://www.med.uni-freiburg.de/de/fakultaet/profs/Eyerich). It was a great chance to meet and connect to scientists from various (Medicine, Biology, Computer science) scientific backgrounds working all on inflammatory skin diseases.
My highlight of the event was to meet my supervisor Natalie Garzorz-Stark and my collaborators Stefanie & Kilian Eyerich in person for the first time and get to know each other better for establishing further collaborations.

### ML x Health Summer school in Oxford
The next highlight followed immediately with the summer school on ML x Health, where I listened to many talks about various applications in health care. For me especially interesting were the ones referring to multi-modal learning, since I am working on one project combining time series data of imaging with transciptomics to identify biomarkers, revealing whether patients are sensitive to a particular drug. 
For the entire topic of multi-modal learning the talk of [Louis-Phillipe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) was extremely inspiring.
